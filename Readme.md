Probabilistic Greenberg-Hastings
====

In this repository, you'll find an implementation of the probabilistic
Greenberg-Hastings automaton. This implementation is the result of two
years of my PhD with Prof. Dr. Leonardo P. Maia, where we were
investigating neuronal avalanches from the point of view of a simple
toy model that mimics basic features in neurodynamics. This model is
based in some papers ([Haldeman & Beggs -
Phys. Rev.](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.058101#fulltext),
[Kinouchi & Copelli - Nat
Phys.](http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v2/n5/full/nphys289.html)). I'm
not just sharing the core code, but also a small example script to
reproduce one of the figures shown in [this
paper](http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.88.012712). You
can find this example in Example folder.
